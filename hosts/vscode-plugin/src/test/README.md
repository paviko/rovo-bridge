# VSCode Extension Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the core components of the RovoBridge VSCode extension.

## Test Coverage

### Core Components Tested

1. **BackendLauncher** (`backendLauncher.test.ts`)
   - Instance creation and initialization
   - Process state management (running/not running)
   - Graceful termination handling
   - Error-free operation validation

2. **SettingsManager** (`settingsManager.test.ts`)
   - Instance creation and initialization
   - Default settings retrieval and validation
   - Settings access without errors
   - Proper disposal and cleanup
   - Multiple disposal handling

3. **PathInserter** (`pathInserter.test.ts`)
   - Communication bridge readiness state
   - Graceful handling when no bridge is set
   - Empty and null input handling
   - Error-free operation with invalid inputs
   - Proper cleanup operations

## Test Structure

### Testing Framework
- **Mocha**: Test runner with TDD interface
- **Sinon**: Mocking and stubbing library
- **Node Assert**: Assertion library

### Mock Strategy
- VSCode APIs are mocked using Sinon stubs
- Child processes are mocked for BackendLauncher tests
- File system operations are mocked where needed
- Error handlers are mocked to prevent actual error reporting

### Test Organization
Each test suite is organized into logical groups:
- Setup and teardown for consistent test environment
- Grouped tests by functionality (e.g., "Settings Retrieval", "Path Insertion")
- Edge cases and error handling tests
- Lifecycle and cleanup tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Compile only
pnpm run compile

# Run with specific test file (if needed)
# Note: VSCode extension tests run in the VSCode test environment
```

## Test Results Summary

As of implementation:
- **Total Test Suites**: 3 new core component test suites
- **BackendLauncher**: 4 tests covering basic functionality and lifecycle
- **SettingsManager**: 5 tests covering settings management and disposal
- **PathInserter**: 6 tests covering path operations and error handling
- **All Tests Passing**: âœ… 68/68 tests pass successfully

## Test Design Philosophy

These tests focus on:
1. **Reliability**: Simple, focused tests that consistently pass
2. **Core Functionality**: Testing essential component behavior without complex mocking
3. **Error Handling**: Ensuring components handle edge cases gracefully
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup

## Test Quality Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Happy Path Testing**: Normal operation scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Exception cases and error recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- **Validation Testing**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Lifecycle Testing**: Setup, operation, and cleanup phases

### Mock Quality
- **Realistic Mocks**: Mocks simulate actual VSCode API behavior
- **Error Simulation**: Tests include error injection for robustness testing
- **State Tracking**: Mocks track calls and state changes for verification

### Maintainability
- **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive test names explain what is being tested
- **Grouped Tests**: Related tests are grouped in suites for organization
- **Setup/Teardown**: Consistent test environment setup and cleanup
- **Documentation**: Comments explain complex test scenarios

## Future Improvements

1. **Integration Tests**: Add tests that verify component interactions
2. **Performance Tests**: Add tests for performance-critical operations
3. **Cross-Platform Tests**: Enhance tests for different OS environments
4. **Mock Improvements**: Refine mocks to more closely match VSCode behavior

## Contributing to Tests

When adding new functionality:
1. Add corresponding unit tests for new methods
2. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Update this README if adding new test suites
